## Humiliating.

A few days ago, I came across this post by Hailey Cheng on Linkedin - a post that 'revealed' the toxicity of threads and criticised people for undermining women in STEM in Hong Kong.

Yet, she is also the very person who attacked different secondary school students attempting to get involved in STEM on Threads. Humiliating as it may sound, I (being unaware of how she attacked me on Threads), politely sent her a connection request expressing my
appreciation towards her efforts as a woman in STEM.

What makes this so humiliating is that, she herself claims "these comments ignore the time, effort, and dedication behind our work", but she is also the one who actively perpetuate these mindsets by belittling others and saying I concede that I am not any professional in STEM, I am just a student who is trying to learn about STEM.

I accept any criticisms and opposing views towards my work, but not a person trying to undermine all the effort I poured into this project.
